// When developing an app that handles JSON data from external or local sources, you might find that the structure of the JSON data does not align perfectly with the way you want to represent it in your app. Often, data that logically belongs together in your Swift code may be spread across multiple nested objects or arrays in the JSON.

// To address these discrepancies, you can create a custom Decodable type that reflects the structure of the incoming JSON. This intermediate type allows you to safely decode the JSON data and serves as a reliable data source when initializing the types you will use throughout your application.

// By employing these intermediate types, you maintain the flexibility to work with the most intuitive and natural types in your code, while still ensuring compatibility with a variety of JSON structures you might encounter.
